# craigslist_nearby_cities
This is a python script that scrapes craigslist to find the nearby cities for a particular city and so on and then a website with a graph created using d3.js.

The resultant d3 graph is resource heavy, which is expected from the hundreds of nodes, and about 30 links per node. 

The script that transforms the output from get_data.py will no longer work with the current version of get_data.py - it will need to be updatad.
