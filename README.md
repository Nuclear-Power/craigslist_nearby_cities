# craigslist_nearby_cities
This is a python script that scrapes craigslist to find the nearby cities for a particular city and so on and then a website with a graph created using d3.js.

The resultant d3 graph is resource heavy, which is expected from the hundreds of nodes, and about 30 links per node. 

The script isn't 100% accurate because some cities have a nearby city of the same name. The one I noticed was Bloomington, IL, which has Bloomington, IN listed as a nearby city. The script did not take this into account. 

The style of the graph could use some work, so feel free to help out with that, or whatever else you want. My code is generally pretty hacky, so any help is appreciated. 

Thanks!
